      CloudLab allows you to build your own cloud, one in which you have
      full control! This means you can run a full suite of cloud software
      of your own compute, networking, and storage. That suite might look
      like one of today's cloud software stacks (for example, maybe it's an
      instance of OpenStack), it might be an incremental improvement to
      today's stacks (for example, replacing the storage layer), or it
      might be something radically different, built from the ground-up to
      support features like real-time computing, integration with
      cyber-physical systems, high performance computing, or energy
      awareness. Your cloud might be only for your own use as you
      experiment with your new architecture, or you could open it up to
      other users to get real application workloads.

      CloudLab is built around profiles. A profile is a description of
      everything needed to build a cloud: the physical hardware (servers,
      disks, switches) and the software needed to transform it into a
      particular type of cloud. A profile is fully packaged and automated:
      building a cloud from scratch may take only minutes, depending on its
      size and complexity. CloudLab will provide "stock" profiles for
      several popular cloud software stacks, but users can modify these or
      build their own from scratch.
