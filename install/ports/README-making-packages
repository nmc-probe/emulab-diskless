Making boss/ops/fs/etc. packages. This is only for the latest FreeBSD
(as of this writing, 10.2/10.3). If you need help with older packages,
check out the initial version of this document.

As of FreeBSD 10, I started using the quarterly ports release at the time
of the OS release and then update the packages quarterly. E.g., 10.2 shipped
with 2015Q3 and I have updated through 2016Q2.

0a. Make sure the ports tree in /share/freebsd/X.Y/ports has the current
   Emulab ports. They are all in the "misc" subdir. If they are out of
   date, update them and remake the ports.tar.gz tarball.

0b. Allocate a node on which to build everything and load the appropriate
   OS on it. Pick a d430 if possible, for the speed and for the SSD. If you
   don't have an SSD, pick a node with multiple disks. I have an experiment
   "emulab-ops/package-builder" that allocates a d820 with three local
   blockstores to take care of step 1 below. If you use that, skip to step 2.
   Or, if you use an SSD, skip step 1 as well and just keep everything on
   the root disk (which should be large enough) in /usr/{src,ports}.

   RANDOM USEFUL PACKAGE COMMAND: to tell what options a FreeBSD package was
   built with:

       pkg query -e "%n=apache22" "%n-%v %Ok %Ov"

   replacing "apache22" with the port of interest (e.g., "perl5.20").

1. Create a couple of extra filesystems for src/ports and the build tree.

   In my emulab-ops/package-builder experiment, I create local blockstores
   /local/{src,ports,obj}.

   I put these on different disks for better performance:

       <login to the node>

       # XXX skip this section if you have blockstores
       sudo mkextrafs /local
       sudo mkextrafs -r /dev/da1 -s 0 /usr/obj
       # make sure soft updates are enabled
       sudo umount /local
       tunefs -n enable /dev/da0s4e
       sudo mount /local
       sudo umount /usr/obj
       tunefs -n enable /dev/da1s1e
       sudo mount /usr/obj

       # XXX if you have a /local/obj blockstore
       sudo rmdir /usr/obj
       sudo ln -s ../local/obj /usr/obj

       # create links and tmpdir
       sudo rmdir /usr/src /usr/ports
       sudo ln -s ../local/src /usr/src
       sudo ln -s ../local/ports /usr/ports
       sudo mkdir /local/src /local/ports /local/tmp
       sudo chmod 1777 /local/tmp

2. Install the src and ports trees. From the node do:

       cd /usr
       sudo tar xzf /share/freebsd/10.2/src.tar.gz
       sudo tar xzf /share/freebsd/10.2/ports.tar.gz

   Note that the FreeBSD source tree (/usr/src) is really only needed
   to build the "lsof" package in emulab-extras.

3. Deinstall all existing ports. You will want to make sure you are root first,
   since this will get rid of "sudo":

       setenv ASSUME_ALWAYS_YES true
       pkg delete -af

4. Be paranoid, clear out old state.

   Remove everything in /var/db/ports. We used to have some non-standard
   settings (well, they were standard at the time!) like no threads for
   Perl. If these old options get propagated, you might not be able to
   mix these packages with official FreeBSD packages which use the default
   options. Clear out everything in /usr/local as well.

       rm -rf /usr/local/*
       rm -rf /var/db/ports/*

   Now you need to reinstall the package manager "pkg". This will happen
   when you do a pkg command, so just do:

       pkg info

   Edit /etc/make.conf and make sure that DEFAULT_VERSIONS exists and is
   correctly set:

   # for 10.2
   DEFAULT_VERSIONS=perl5=5.20 python=2.7 php=5.6 mysql=5.5 apache=2.2 tcltk=8.6

5. Set non-standard options on some ports.

    * Perl. For perl 5.20 make sure that THREADS is defined. It should be,
      but it can cause a lot of grief if not. To be safe go into lang/perl5.20
      and do "make config" and make sure THREADS is checked.
    * Boost. We use the boost-all package which includes docs. I generally
      prefer not to drag around the docs, so I go into devel/boost-all, do
      a "make config" and deselect the DOCS box. Now when you do the make
      in emulab-boss, it should use that config when it gets to boost.
    * Git. Go into the devel/git directory, do a "make config" and deselect
      the GUI box. Otherwise it will drag in possibly conflicting versions of
      TCL and TK.
    * Pubsub. If the pubsub libraries are installed but were installed by hand
      and not through the port, then they will cause the port to not be
      installed as part of the emulab-boss port (since the dependency in the
      boss Makefile will be satisfied). This will cause an error when creating
      packages. If you have removed everything in /usr/local, you should be
      okay. Otherwise, the easiest fix is to just remove
      /usr/local/lib/libpubsub*, which is what the Makefile checks for.
    * Cairo. In graphics/cairo, turn off OPENGL. Let's see if that keeps it
      from dragging in llvm and clang.
    * Apache. The last couple of package sets I built did not have PROXY
      turned on. I have fixed this in the Makefile (I think) but you may
      also want to go into www/apache22 and set: SUEXEC, PROXY, PROXY_HTTP
      to be safe. The proxy code is needed on the mothership ops for the
      Wiki but should not hurt anywhere else.
    * Emacs. I used to build the -nox11 varient so we didn't drag in a ton
      of crap, but Leigh prefers the real deal and came up with a reasonable
      set of options. These are now baked into the emulab-extras Makefile.
      If you get an error from the Makefile about "m17n support requires Xft"
      then you probably have an old options file. You should remove
      /var/db/ports/emacs/options. NOTE! For FBSD10, the WITHOUT_foo options
      no longer do anything. Until further notice you will have to "make
      config" manually and uncheck:
        DBUS, GCONF, GIF, GSETTINGS, M17N, MAGICK, OTF, PNG, SCROLLBARS,
        SOUND, SVG, TIFF, XFT, XIM, XPM, GTK2
      and check:
        XAW

6. Now begin the tedious, iterative process. First, do:

       setenv PACKAGES /usr/obj/ports/packages
       # if no SSD then...
       setenv TMPDIR /local/tmp

   The former ensures that packages wind up in a single directory. The latter
   will force the compiler (and other utilities) to use /local/tmp for
   temporary files if you don't have an SSD.

   Now for each emulab-* port you install, you will need to perform the ritual
   steps below:

       rm -f $PACKAGES/All/*
       setenv FLAGS ""
       foreach d (boss ops fs protogeni tipserv extras)
           (cd /usr/ports/misc/emulab-$d ; make $FLAGS clean all install)
	   (cd /usr/ports/misc/emulab-$d ; make $FLAGS clean)
       end
       pkg create -a -o $PACKAGES/All/

   If a build fails due to an outstanding vulnerability, first try updating the
   ports with SVN to see if it has been addressed. If that doesn't work, you will
   have to build with the vulnerability check disabled. Set:

       setenv FLAGS DISABLE_VULNERABILITIES=1

   and do the above loop again.

   Then from ops do:
       mkdir /share/freebsd/x.x/packages
       cd /share/freebsd/x.x/packages
       scp -p pcXXX:/usr/obj/ports/packages/All/\* .

6b. Painful post-port processing.
    * I don't always do it, but after all the ports are installed run
      pkg audit and see what security vulnerabilities there are. Manually
      update the ports and make notes in /share/freebsd/x.x/README.ports.
      This is fraught with peril however. Some ports versions are assumed in
      various other ports and things can degenerate rapidly when you try to
      do this! See one of the existing README.ports files for examples.
    * Install the bsdadmintools port (sysutils/bsdadmintools) and run
      "pkg_libchk" to ensure that all the library dependencies of the ports
      are correctly resolved.

7. Now you should have a fully functional set of packages. The last thing to
   do is make sure they install. ON YOUR BUILD NODE (NOT on boss or ops!) do
   the following and watch for any errors (there will be plenty of
   informational messages). See 9 below for an alternative testing method.

       sudo tcsh
       cd /share/freebsd/x.x/packages

       setenv ASSUME_ALWAYS_YES true
       alias PA "pkg add"
       alias PD "pkg delete -af ; pkg info"
       alias PC "pkg check -Bda"
       alias PL "pkg install bsdadminscripts ; /usr/local/sbin/pkg_libchk"

       # make sure you are not on boss or ops!
       hostname -s | grep -Eq '^(boss|ops)$' && \
           (echo 'STOP! you are on boss or ops, ^C now!'; sleep 100000; exit)

       # all possible boss-install packages
       PD
       PA emulab-boss*
       PA emulab-protogeni*
       PA emulab-fs*
       PA emulab-tipserv*
       PA emulab-extras*
       PC
       PL

       # all possible ops-install packages
       PD
       PA emulab-ops*
       PA emulab-fs*
       PA emulab-tipserv*
       # may already be installed
       PA adodb*
       PA emulab-extras*
       PC
       PL

       # all possible fs-install packages
       PD
       PA emulab-fs*
       PA emulab-extras*
       PC
       PL

       # all (someday) possible tipserv-install packages
       PD
       PA emulab-tipserv*
       PA emulab-extras*
       PC
       PL

8. Managing the package repository.

a. Out on boss:/usr/testbed/www/FreeBSD, make a directory for the FreeBSD release
   (e.g., 10.2), and in that a directory called "packages". Copy all the .txz
   package files into that.

b. On boss, run:

   # XXX we need to add pubkey or other authentication
   sudo pkg repo /usr/testbed/www/FreeBSD/10.2/packages

   to create the metadata files needed.

c. As part of the boss/ops/etc. install, we will need to start creating a file
   /etc/pkg/Emulab.conf with:

   Emulab: {
     url: "https://www.emulab.net/FreeBSD/10.2/packages",
     mirror_type: NONE,
     enabled: yes
   }

   (We should add either fingerprint or pubkey authentication here. See, e.g.:
   http://www.glenbarber.us/2012/06/11/Maintaining-Your-Own-pkgng-Repository.html)

d. When packages are installed on boss/ops/etc., we need to make sure to use

   sudo pkg install -r Emulab ...

   to identify them as coming from the Emulab repository and then, when everything
   is installed:

   sudo pkg annotate -ay -A repository Emulab

   to annotate all the packages as coming from the Emulab repo. This ensures that
   our fixed versions of packages don't get upgraded to newer versions.

9. Alternative test method using Emulab repo.

  Another way to verify packages, assuming you have setup the repository
  mentioned in #8 above.

    sudo tcsh

    # make sure you are not on boss or ops!
    hostname -s | grep -Eq '^(boss|ops)$' && \
        (echo 'STOP! you are on boss or ops, ^C now!'; sleep 100000; exit)

    pkg delete -af
    rm -rf /usr/local/*

    setenv ASSUME_ALWAYS_YES true
    alias PA "pkg install -r Emulab"
    alias PD "pkg delete -af"
    alias PC "pkg check -Bda"
    alias PL "pkg install bsdadminscripts ; /usr/local/sbin/pkg_libchk"

  If you have an /etc/pkg/Emulab.conf, move it out of the way:
    mv /etc/pkg/Emulab.conf /tmp/

  And bootstrap with:
    pkg info
    pkg install ca_root_nss
    pkg lock pkg
    pkg lock ca_root_nss

  Now create /etc/pkg/Emulab.conf with:
    Emulab: {
      url: "https://www.emulab.net/FreeBSD/10.2/packages",
      mirror_type: NONE,
      enabled: yes
    }
  or move back you existing one:
   mv /tmp/Emulab.conf /etc/pkg/

  Now you can cycle through the installs:

       # all possible boss-install packages
       PD
       PA emulab-boss
       PA emulab-protogeni
       PA emulab-fs
       PA emulab-tipserv
       PA emulab-extras
       PC
       PL

       # all possible ops-install packages
       PD
       PA emulab-ops
       PA emulab-fs
       PA emulab-tipserv
       # may already be installed
       PA adodb
       PA emulab-extras
       PC
       PL

       # all possible fs-install packages
       PD
       PA emulab-fs
       PA emulab-extras
       PC
       PL

       # all (someday) possible tipserv-install packages
       PD
       PA emulab-tipserv
       PA emulab-extras
       PC
       PL

10. Updating the Emulab package repo (10.2 specific).

   [ This is a condensed version of the steps above. ]
   
   Occasionally you will want to make sure the ports are up to date.
   We track the "quarterly" branch of ports, so within a three month
   period, it should only be updated for security fixes and critical
   problems. I am sure that using "poudriere" is the way to do this,
   but here is what I am currently doing: I just build a new set of
   packages from scratch and replace the old ones! "pkg upgrade" on
   a client seems smart enough to avoid reinstalling everything just
   because the package times have changed. It still seems to do a
   couple of mysterious updates of things that didn't change, but I
   can live with that...

   a. Make sure the ports tree in /share/freebsd/10.2/ports on ops
      is up to date. [ Note that there is not actually an svn repo branch
      called "quarterly" so you have to make sure you are tracking the
      current quarter. ]

      cd /share/freebsd/10.2/ports
      sudo svn update

   b. Swapin the emulab-ops/package-builder experiment.
      Make sure the blockstores are used:

      sudo rmdir /usr/src /usr/ports /usr/obj
      sudo ln -s ../local/src /usr/src
      sudo ln -s ../local/ports /usr/ports
      sudo ln -s ../local/obj /usr/obj

      Note that we leave /tmp as the tmpdir since the MBR3 based root FS
      has plenty of room.

   c. Extract the sources:

      cd /local
      sudo tar xzf /share/freebsd/10.2/src.tar.gz
      sudo tar xzf /share/freebsd/10.2/ports-2016Q1.tar.gz

   c. Cleanse the port environment:

      sudo tcsh
      setenv ASSUME_ALWAYS_YES true
      pkg delete -af
      rm -rf /usr/local/*
      rm -rf /var/db/ports/*
      pkg bootstrap
      pkg install pkgconf

   d. Make sure port options are correctly set (as of 10.2, steps 5a, 5g
      above):

      - in devel/boost-all, "make config" and deselect:
          DOCS
      - in editors/emacs, "make config" and deselect:
          DBUS, GCONF, GIF, GSETTINGS, M17N, MAGICK, OTF, PNG, SCROLLBARS,
          SOUND, SVG, TIFF, XFT, XIM, XPM, GTK2
        and select:
	  XAW
      - in graphics/cairo, "make config" and deselect OPENGL.
      - in www/apache22, "make config" and select: SUEXEC, PROXY, PROXY_HTTP

   e. Build em all and create packages:

       setenv PACKAGES /usr/obj/ports/packages
       rm -f $PACKAGES/All/*
       foreach d (boss ops fs protogeni tipserv extras)
           (cd /usr/ports/misc/emulab-$d ; make clean all install)
	   (cd /usr/ports/misc/emulab-$d ; make clean)
       end
       pkg create -a -o $PACKAGES/All/

   f. Save packages and update tarball and repo. On boss:

      cd /share/freebsd/10.2
      mkdir packages
      scp pcXXX:/usr/obj/ports/packages/All/\* packages/
      sudo chown -R root:wheel packages

      set www=/usr/testbed/www
      set tball="FreeBSD-10.2-packages-64-`date +%Y%m%d`.tar.gz"

      sudo tar czf $tball packages
      sudo cp $tball $www/downloads/
      sudo ln -sf $tball $www/downloads/FreeBSD-10.2-packages-64.tar.gz
      sudo mv $www/FreeBSD/10.2/{packages,Opackages}
      sudo cp -rp packages $www/FreeBSD/10.2/
      sudo pkg repo $www/FreeBSD/10.2/packages

      sudo mv packages-64 packages-64.bak
      sudo mv packages packages-64

11. Client node packages.

   Someday we will want to make an emulab-client meta port and packages.
   Here are some notes from when I installed a fresh a set of packages on
   the FreeBSD 9.3 image.

   a. Put in /etc/make.conf:

      DEFAULT_VERSIONS=perl5=5.20 python=2.7 mysql=5.5

   b. Build/install pubsub from source.

   c. Ports installed:

      perl5
      p5-DBI
      p5-Socket
      p5-Storable
      p5-Time-HiRes
      p5-XML-Parser
      python2
      py27-libxml2
      autoconf
      automake
      bash
      bison
      boost-libs (would really, really like to get rid of this)
      compat8x-amd64
      curl
      e2fsprogs (don't really need this...)
      emacs-nox11
      flex
      git
      gmake
      isc-dhcp43-client
      jove
      libtool
      linux_base-c6
      lsof
      mysql51-client (5.1 since it might be talking to older ops node)
      net-snmp
      patch
      readline
      rpm4
      rsync
      smartmontools
      subversion
      sudo
      ttcp
      unzip
      vim-lite
      wget
      xterm
      zip

   d. Don't forget to make /usr/bin/perl symlink!

12. Diffing packages. Assuming old (current) packages are in packages
    and new packages in packages.tmp. Note that the file diff does not
    include the hashes as they seem to change just when a file is rebuilt.
    For options, we do not include the version so that we can detect changes
    in options even with different versions; e.g., we accidentally built the
    new version of something with the wrong options.

    cd packages
    rm *.txt
    /bin/ls > 1.Packages.txt
    foreach f (*.txz)
	pkg query -F $f "%n-%v %dn-%dv" | sort +1 >> 2.Deps.txt
	pkg query -F $f "%n-%v %Fp" | sort +1 >> 3.Files.txt
	pkg query -F $f "%n %Ok %Ov" | sort +1 >> 4.Options.txt
    end
    cd ..

    cd packages.tmp
    rm *.txt
    /bin/ls > 1.Packages.txt
    foreach f (*.txz)
	pkg query -F $f "%n-%v %dn-%dv" | sort +1 >> 2.Deps.txt
	pkg query -F $f "%n-%v %Fp" | sort +1 >> 3.Files.txt
	pkg query -F $f "%n %Ok %Ov" | sort +1 >> 4.Options.txt
    end
    cd ..

    By diffing 1.Packages.txt you can determine the new packages/versions
    that are needed.

    By diffing 2.Deps.txt you will find all the packages that depend on
    those new packages/versions or ones that have new/different dependencies.
